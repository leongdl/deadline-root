## Integrations
This GitHub org has integrations (such as job submission plugins) for a selection of digital content creation (DCC) software. These integrations allow users to submit jobs from inside their favorite applications. See documentation in the individual repos for more info about features, usage, and compatibility.

Deadline Cloud supports service-managed fleets (SMF) and customer-managed fleets (CMF). With SMF, Deadline Cloud fully manages the workers running the jobs and includes access to some pre-packaged software applications for convenience. With CMF, the workers run on any customer-managed compute platform such as AWS EC2 or on-premise servers, and all configuration is handled by the customer. Integrations on SMF are intended to work out-of-the-box with minimal configuration; use CMF to fully customize your systems and software.
